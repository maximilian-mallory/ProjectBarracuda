# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
2.	Software dependencies
3.	Latest releases
4.	API references

RYAN MADE IT INTO THE CLONED REPOSITORY

# Rules for Organizing Code
The file directories will be separated into two main directories
    Barracuda is the configuration directory with our django settings and URLs
    GeoGuessr is the app level directory. GeoGuessr contains the directories for Static files and Templates
The api-key exists in the root directory. This will not change. No other root directories should be needed.
We will use Model, View, Controller structure. These folders will be in the app level directory
There will be no duplication of functionality or structure. 

# Rules for code changes 
Should be finished and functional 
Should be fractional if updating current code 
Can be large if new feature not touching other code
Updates will be posted in teams channel
Notes must be clear and concise 

# Definition of Done
To be moved from 'in-progess' to 'resolved', code must be fully functional, have minimal or no bugs, and meets the desired outcome of the work item pulled from the backlog.
Contributors will each a Git branch to place items for peer review prior to committing to main.\
Items should be tested fully before being moved to user branch.
The user branch will allow peers to pull code for review. 
Once tested and revied, move from user branch to main.
Once committed to main, work item can be placed in resolved.
Items moved from in-progress to resolved must be tested before being placed in resolved. 
Items for each sprint will sit in resolved until all related items have been resolved and the items have been proven to cooperate effectively without errors.
If planning is effective, items will sit in resolved for no more than one week.
The goal is for no items in any board slot to be moved backward.

# Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests. 

# Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
