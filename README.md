Project Barracuda was a collaborative effort by myself, Colten Crider, Jacob Henderson, Ryan Vasek, and Jacob Titus.
The goal of the project was to create a fun and interactive game that mimics GeoGuessr.
Map services are loaded using the Google StreetView Javascript API.
This project utilizes the Django Python web framework to run a full-stack application locally in the browser.
All configurations are set to run locally.
See individual commits for task responsibility.
This repository has been moved from Azure DevOps to GitHub, so there is no active KanBan board.
Project complete May 6, 2024
